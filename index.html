            <li>Heat the milk in a saucepan without bringing it to a boil. Add sugar and cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>At the same time, prepare a water bath. Melt the butter on it.</li>
            <li>"Mix" the milk mixture and already liquid butter. Mix thoroughly with a silicone spatula so that the mass becomes
            uniform and silky.</li>
            <li>Heat the mixture over low heat, letting it barely boil.</li>
            <li>Pour the chocolate into special containers (can be replaced with ice molds). Allow to cool and harden.</li>
